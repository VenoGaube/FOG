# Knowledge base

This part of the project focuses on storing data in the OriginTrail decetralized knowledge graphs (DKG).

## Properties of Origin trail

OriginTrail is an ecosystem that connects Layer 1 techologies such as Ethereum with its graph technology on Layer 2. For storing the diles in the DKG, we need to run a node (local for deelopment) and run the node on OriginTrails testnet and later mainnet.

We can interact with the node with DKG SDKs and create graph-native Web3 applications.

DKG enables you to 

* Easily discover, query and integrate datasets from multiple sources

* Securely share semantic data (knowledge) across systems and dapps

* Easily build custom verifiable data pipelines

* Integrate with existing SSI & blockchain tooling
