# Goals go L2 project
Goals as discussed during lab session (11.5.2022)

We are trying to provide an academic chain, which would facilitate decentralised paper and possibly other applications.

## Main points
- target is to provide a chain to deploy decentralised journal and possibly other applications
- most prominent is plasma-like sidechain approach
- Proof of Authority (each academic  institution holds piece of authority)
- every institution could download config and run note, but should be accepted by others to hold authority
- some sort of tokenomics
    - exchange between sidechain token and ether
    - alternatively exchange to token, generated via etherium smart contract
