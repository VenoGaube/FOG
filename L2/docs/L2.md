# Etherium Layer 2

## What is layer 2?
Layer 2  (L2) is a term combining different scaling approaches with aim of greater transaction speeds, lower gas fees and different governing solutions in combination with [Etherium][1] main net, while trying to remain as secure as possible. Etherium Layer 2 network is in fact a separate blockchain that extends Etherium.

## How it works
Different L2 approaches use [different solutions][2] to extend Etherium main net (L1). This include bundling transactions on L2 chain and submitting them to L1 (rollups), running parallel payment channel and only submitting balance to main net when closing channel (State / payment channels), 

## Rollups
Rollups are the the most promising L2 solutions. The main idea behind this approach is to preform transactions off chain, possibly on another side chain, periodically  bundling them together and submitting them to L1 network. 

Rollups have many benefits over using bare main net. By combining multiple transactions into one, main net's gas fees get distributed over the whole bundle, which makes them much cheaper. They also increase speed while still maintaining a high level of security, which is derived from Etherium main network. 

There are two different approaches: Optimistic rollups and zero-knowledge rollups.
### Optimistic rollups
[Optimistic rollups][3] batch transactions in one bundle and submit them to main net. The name `optimistic` comes from the fact that rollups by default assume all submitted transactions are **valid** and do not perform proofs or submit them to main chain. Instead, this approach employs a `fraud-prevention` scheme in which any node can challenge the result. After so-called challenge period (which lasts cca. 7 days) passes, transactions are deemed valid and are accepted to Etherium mainnet.

Optimistic rollups have many benefits. As most of L2 approaches, they offer up to 100x decrease in gas fees  while still maintaining high level of security and trustlessness. Execution is transparent, transaction data is stored on L1. Fraud proving is open to **any node** **without special hardware** which makes the process highly decentralized. Security is achieved by respecting minorities, even one honest node can submit a  successful **fraud challenge**, which is respected. Security is further increased by well-designed **cryptoeconomic model**, where rollup operators must provide a bond, which gets slashed in case of dishonesty. And finally, compatibility with EVM and solidity simplifies porting dApps between L1 and L2  nets.

This approach also has some drawbacks. The biggest being a huge **delay in transaction finality**, where transactions are only considered valid after a long challenge period, which lasts roughly 7 days. This makes really long delay in transferring funds L2 > L1, while L1 > L2 usually takes a couple of minutes. Long delay can be hedged using **liquidity providers**, which, for a fee, assume ownership of pending L2 withdrawal and compensate by other funds already on L1. Another drawback is a possibility of malicious attack in case no node is honest. Since transactions are not validated unless at least one of the nodes submits a challenge, if no node does it, attack can succeed. This, hoverer is a highly unlikely event, which makes optimistic rollups a very secure L2 solution. 

### Zero-knowledge rollups
A [zero-knowledge rollups][4] (zk-rollups) work  similarly then optimistic rollups. They also perform transaction on separate L2 layer, combine them into one bundle but there ends similarity. Instead of transactions, zk-rollups only submit *last state* of all the accounts in rollup combined with *validity proofs* for the last state. Proofs then get verified on L1 and are accepted as valid transactions. Transactions are therefore deemed final when L1 accepts proofs, which happens in minutes instead of in 7 days, as in optimistic rollups. 

Zk-rollups are usually less decentrialised as optimistic rollups. Role of operator, which combines L2 transactions, also called `sequencer` is usually only preformed by on "supernode", although this role can be passed around according to proof-of-stake system. This is a single point of failure and opportunity for censorship. To prevent this, users can also bypass operator and submit L2 transactions directly to smart contract.

The next phase before submitting transactions to L1 is generation of proofs, which is usually done by proofer. Validity proofs provide evidence that each transaction in batch itself is valid, it is actually contained in batch and that batch as a whole is valid. Proofs then gets checked by L1 smart contract.

Zk-rollups have many benefits over other approaches. Validity proofs guarantee with cryptographic certainty the correctness of transactions, which can easily be checked.  Therefore, there is no 7d days "challenge period", as with optimistic rollups, which makes for much faster transaction finality. Data is stored on L1, which brings transparency an resiliency. Since data is compressed, the cost of publishing it on Etherium low which brings lower fees for transactions, even lower then optimistic rollups.

This approach also has some drawbacks. For starter, generation of proofs is a costly endeavour, which can increase transaction fees. Generation of proofs require some adjustments. They require specialized hardware, and specialized zk-rollups-compatible EVM, which is hard. All the difficulties lower the number of participants in the network,  which consequently lowers decentralization and security. Some implementation of proof generation (ZK-SNARK) also require trusted environment, which is another vulnerability.
